## Getting Started

To set up and use the provided extension code you need to perform the following steps :

### Download sample code
1. Download a `ci360-extensions` project source code into zip/tar.gz/tar.bz2/tar file format on your local machine.<br/>
   `Note:` You can also clone the project on your local machine

2. The project will be downloaded on your local machine in your specified file format. You need to unzip/untar the downloaded project.  

3. You can see the folder `ci360-extensions` after unzip/untar the project.

4. Open the `ci360-extensions` folder. It will contain multiple sub-folders for various connector and agent integration resources.

### Build or Deploy
Build and deployment instructions are included for each of the integration assets in their respoective sub-folders.


### Deploying CI360 Connectors
Please refer [Set up a Custom Connector](https://go.documentation.sas.com/doc/en/cintcdc/production.a/cintag/ext-connectors-custom.htm) section in SAS Customer Intelligence 360 admin guide.

##### Register your connector into CI360

For most connector or agent integration assets, you need to register the connector and endpoint with these details into the CI360 system to use the connector. Details are included for each connector or agent in their sub-folders. Documentation sections are referenced below for eacy access.

**Add and Register a Connector**
Please refer to [`Add and Register a Connector`](https://go.documentation.sas.com/doc/en/cintcdc/production.a/cintag/ext-connectors-add.htm) in SAS Customer Intelligence 360 admin guide.

**Add an Endpoint**
Please refer to [`Add an Endpoint`](https://go.documentation.sas.com/doc/en/cintcdc/production.a/cintag/ext-connectors-add-endpoint.htm) in SAS Customer Intelligence 360 admin guide.

### Deploying CI360 Agents

For CI360 agent development, agent SDK needs to be downloaded and installed into the local Maven repository. See [`Download the General Agent`](https://go.documentation.sas.com/doc/en/cintcdc/production.a/cintag/gen-access-download.htm) in SAS Customer Intelligence 360 admin guide. General Agent includes the SDK.

To install SDK JAR into local Maven repository:
```
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=<path where CI360 agent was downloaded>/sdk/mkt-agent-sdk-jar-1.current release.jar -DpomFile=path where CI360 agent was downloaded/sdk/pom.xml
```

**Create an Access Point Definition**
Please refer to [`Create an Access Point Definition`](https://go.documentation.sas.com/doc/en/cintcdc/production.a/cintag/extapi-config-agentdefa.htm) in SAS Customer Intelligence 360 admin guide.

### Extension Best Practices

##### Logging and PII

Many agents and connectors included here log information for debugging purposes, either in local log files or cloud based logging services. While connectors and agents generally won't explicitly log any PII data, some include mechanism for logging complete CI360 event objects, based on logging levels configured, usually controlled using logging specific configuration files. In order to avoid logging or storage of PII data, it is a best practice to either disable logging by setting the logging level, or exclude PII data from being sent by CI360.
